            <h2>React</h2>
            <p>Declarative: React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes. Declarative views make your code more predictable, simpler to understand, and easier to debug.</p>
            <p>Component-Based: Build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs. Since component logic is written in JavaScript instead of templates, you can easily pass rich data through your app and keep state out of the DOM.</p>
            <p>Learn Once, Write Anywhere: We don't make assumptions about the rest of your technology stack, so you can develop new features in React without rewriting existing code. React can also render on the server using Node and power mobile apps using React Native.</p>
            <h2>Installation</h2>
            <p>React is available as the react package on npm. It is also available on a CDN.</p>
            <p>React is flexible and can be used in a variety of projects. You can create new apps with it, but you can also gradually introduce it into an existing codebase without doing a rewrite.</p>
            <p>The recommended way to install React depends on your project. Here you can find short guides for the most common scenarios:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Trying Out React</li>
                <li>Creating a New Application</li>
                <li>Adding React to an Existing Application</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Contributing</h2>
            <p>The main purpose of this repository is to continue to evolve React core, making it faster and easier to use. Development of React happens in the open on GitHub, and we are grateful to the community for contributing bugfixes and improvements. Read below to learn how you can take part in improving React.</p>
